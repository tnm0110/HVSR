# HVSR Calculation for Nodal Seismometers
This repository contains MATLAB scripts and functions to calculate HVSR (Horizontal-to-Vertical Spectral Ratio) on nodal seismometers using ambient noise. It employs the STA/LTA algorithm and density-based clustering (DBSCAN) to isolate transient spikes from the noise window.

# Key Files:
run_hvsr.m: The main script to calculate HVSR.
Example Dataset: An example dataset is included to help you set up the parameters correctly.
Feel free to reach out if you need additional information or assistance.
